# Project 1 MicroService API

I have converted project 1 to a simple API microservice.
It basically gets requests and generates planets and returns coordinates of stars, types of planets etc. as json objects.
Also, I created a simulator which can be found in here.
It gets all of its data from this API.

Clone this repository

python index.py

Then server will start in your localhost:8080. 
You have to keep open your local server to star simulator.


Note!! In default, it only generates 20 stars, if you have better system configuration than i have, you can increase the number.
